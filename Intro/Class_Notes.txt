	Who are all involved in this whole software development process :
	
		-	Business Analyst
		-	Appln. Architect
		-	Dev Team
		-	Project Manager
		- 	Team Lead
		-	Test Engg.
		-	Release Engg.
		-	Prod Team for Deployments
		-	Delivery Manager
		-	DB Admins
		-	Monitoring 
		- 	Infra-Structure Team
		-	QA Team


	Traditional SDLC Process:: AGILE 
	
		-	Business Analyst,Delivery Manager,Appln. Architect 	===> 
		- 	Infra-Structure Team								===> Provision infra
		-	Project Manager, Team Lead, Dev Team				===> Develop appln.
		-	DB Admins											===> DB Management
		- 	Test Lead, Test Engg., QA Team						===> Thorough testing 			
		-	Release Engg., Prod Team for Deployments			===> Prod Deployment/Rel.
		-	Monitoring 											===> To maintain stable production envi.

		Matured SDLC Strategies that can eliminate all these issues 
		
	DevOps :: SDLC Strategies --- 
		
	DevOps Stages :

		Devteam --- Develop application
		
		Continuous Development : Tools like IDEs integrated with DevOps Tools.
			Understanding the design doc. 	--> Code --> Build Code --> Create Artifacts --> Unit test
											--> Publish/promote the appln to Testing Team for further Testing
											--> Work on bug fixing
			
			Code ==> Developed IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) - Visual Studio Code, Eclipse based IDEs
			Application Build : Compile the source code --- Create the executables(binaries)/Artifacts 
			Unit Testing 
		
		Continuous Integration : Ensures high frequency of code integration for further testing.
		
		Continuous Testing : DevOps introduces Automated Testing Tool to achieve Continuous Testing.
		
		Continuous Delivery / Deployment ::: Is strategy that helps to speed-up production releases.
		
		Continuous Delivery (vs) Deployment 
		
		Environments :::
		
		Non-Prod Environment										Prod Environment 
		
		DEV 
		Build
		Test
			QA 
			UAT 											===>	Prod 
		
		Continuous Delivery 	===> Requires Manual Approvals from various stakeholders
											Security Audits
		
		Continuous Deployment 	===> This doesn't expects any Manual intervension -- It is completly automated.
										i.e., without manual approval we can do the production releases.

	DevOps is a Software Development strategy which promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Teams to achieve Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment in more automated fashion.

	It consists of various stages like, Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring.

	What is your Role ?
	
		- 	Infra-Structure Team								===> Provision infra
		-	Project Manager, Team Lead, Dev Team				===> Develop appln.
		-	DB Admins											===> DB Management
		- 	Test Lead, Test Engg., QA Team						===> Thorough testing 			
		-	Release Engg., Prod Team for Deployments			===> Prod Deployment/Rel.
		-	Monitoring 											===> To maintain stable production envi.

			What is programming?
			Java Programming
			Python Programming
		
		Software Program ???
		
		-	set of instruction ?
		-	task ?
		- 	set of inputs & outputs
		- 	type of written lang.
	
		Programming Lang. is secondary!!!!
		
			ADA, BASIC, COBOL, .Net,c,c++ Java, python, nodejs, angular,........
	
		Task??		
		How to build the task??
